                <h1 id="actuators">Actuators</h1>
<p>A car needs a way to to move forward and backward and to turn left and right.  We commonly call devices that produce a physical movement in the robot 'actuators'.  Common actuators are DC motors, Servo motors, continuous servo motors and stepper motors.  There are many, many different ways that these actuators can be combined to propel and turn a robot.  Donkeycar supports two common configurations that can be implemented with various actuators: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Car-like vehicles</strong> steer by angling the front wheels left or right and move by turning the drive wheels forward or reverse. Common RC cars fall in this category.</li>
<li><strong>Differential drive vehicles</strong>  have two independently controlled drive wheels to provide both movement and steering.  For instance a differential drive car can be driven straight forward by turning the two drive wheels forward at the same speed. In order to turn, one motor can be driven faster than the other and the car will turn an arc in the direction of the slower motor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actuators take control signals from the Donkeycar to control their actions.  There are several options for generating these control signals.
- PCA9685 Servo controller board
- RPi/Jetson 40 pin GPIO header
  - see <a href="../pins/#generating-pwm-from-the-jetson-nano">Generating PWM from the Jetson Nano</a> for how to enable PWM output from the Jetson Nano 40 pin GPIO header.
- Arduino</p>
<p>Below we will describe the supported actuator setups and software configuration of their control signals.</p>
<h2 id="standard-rc-with-esc-and-steering-servo">Standard RC with ESC and Steering Servo.</h2>
<p>A standard RC car is equipped with a steering servo for steering the front wheels and an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) to control the speed of the DC motor driving the wheels.  Both the steering servo and the ESC take a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control signal.  A PWM signal is simply a square wave pulse of a certain duration and frequency.  In the case of the steering servo the PWM signal determines the position of the servo's arm, which is generally between 0 degrees (full right) and 180 degrees (full left).  In the case of the ESC the PWM signal determines the direction and speed of the drive motor, from full reverse, through stopped, to full forward.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard RC servo pulses range from 1 millisecond (full reverse for ESC, fully left for servo) to 2 milliseconds (full forward for ESC, full right for servo) with 1.5 milliseconds being neutral (stopped for ESC, straight for servo).</li>
<li>These pulses are typically sent at 50 hertz (one duty cycle every 20 milliseconds). One duty cycle includes a period where the signal is brought high followed by a period where the signal is brought low.  This means that, using the standard 50hz frequency, a 1 millisecond pulse (1 ms high followed by 19 ms low) represents a 5% duty cycle and a 2 millisecond pulse represents a 10% duty cycle.</li>
<li>The most important part is the length of the pulse; it must be in the range of 1 to 2 milliseconds.  </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="A diagram showing typical PWM timing for a servomotor (Wikipedia)" src="../assets/parts/Servomotor_Timing_Diagram.svg" title="A diagram showing typical PWM timing for a servomotor (Wikipedia)" /></p>
<ul>
<li>So this means that if a different frequency is used, then the duty cycle must be adjusted in order to get the 1ms to 2ms pulse.</li>
<li>For instance, if a 60hz frequency is used, then a 1 ms pulse requires a duty cycle of 0.05 * 60 / 50 = 0.06 (6%) duty cycle</li>
<li>We default the frequency of our PCA9685 to 60 hz, so pulses in config are generally based on 60hz frequency and 12 bit values. We use 12 bit values because the PCA9685 has 12 bit resolution. So a 1 ms pulse is 0.06 * 4096 ~= 246, a neutral pulse of 0.09 duty cycle is 0.09 * 4096 ~= 367 and full forward pulse of 0.12 duty cycles is 0.12 * 4096 ~= 492</li>
<li>These are generalizations that are useful for understanding the underlying api call arguments and the values that are generating when calibrating.  The final choice of duty-cycle/pulse length depends on your hardware and perhaps your strategy (you may not want to go too fast,  and so you may choose is low max throttle pwm)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="generating-pwm-pulses-with-a-pca9685-servo-controller">Generating PWM pulses with a PCA9685 Servo controller</h3>
<ul>
<li>The hardware connection of the PCA9685 I2C servo driver board is described fully in the overall setup instructions <a href="../guide/build_hardware.md">here</a></li>
<li>The PCA9685 Servo controller is connected the RaspberryPi or Jetson Nano via the I2C pins on the 40 Pin bus, then the 3 pin cables from the ESC and Steering Servo are connected to the PCA9685, generally to channel 0 and channel 1 respectively. See <a href="../guide/build_hardware.md#step-4-connect-servo-shield-to-raspberry-pi">Step 4: Connect Servo Shield</a>.   Connection of a PCA9685 to a Jetson Nano is the same.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>DRIVE_TRAIN_TYPE = "PWM_STEERING_THROTTLE"</code> in myconfig.py</li>
<li>Set the pin specifiers for PCA9685 in the <code># PWM_STEERING_THROTTLE</code> section of myconfig.py. For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">  PWM_STEERING_PIN = &quot;PCA9685.1:40.0&quot;  # PCA9685, I2C bus 1, address 0x40, channel 0
  PWM_THROTTLE_PIN = &quot;PCA9685.1:40.1&quot;  # PCA9685, I2C bus 1, address 0x40, channel 1
</code></pre>

<h3 id="generating-pwm-pulses-from-the-40-pin-gpio-header">Generating PWM pulses from the 40 pin GPIO header</h3>
<ul>
<li>Here the PWM signal is generated from the 40 pin GPIO header.  The data pin on the 3-pin ESC and Servo connectors are connected to a PWM pin on the GPIO.  The ground pins on the 3-pin connectors are connected to a common ground.  The 5V pins on the 3-pin connectors are connected to the 5V pins on the GPIO: the 3-pin connector from the ESC will generally provide 5V that can then be used to power the Servo. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>DRIVE_TRAIN_TYPE = "PWM_STEERING_THROTTLE"</code> in myconfig.py</li>
<li>Set the pin specifiers for GPIO in the <code># PWM_STEERING_THROTTLE</code> section. Note that each pin has both a BOARD mode and a BCM (Broadcom) mode identifier.  You can use either mode, but all pins must use the same mode.  For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">  PWM_STEERING_PIN = &quot;RPI_GPIO.BOARD.33&quot;  # GPIO board mode pin-33 == BCM mode pin-13
  PWM_THROTTLE_PIN = &quot;RPI_GPIO.BOARD.12&quot;  # GPIO board mode pin-12 == BCM mode pin-18

<h3 id="arduino">Arduino</h3>
<p>Arduino can be used in the following fashion to generate PWM signals to control the steering and throttle.</p>
<p>For now the Arduino mode is only tested on the <a href="https://www.lattepanda.com/products/lattepanda-delta-432.html">Latte Panda Delta (LP-D)</a> board.
However it should be straightforward to use it with Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano (instead of PCA 9685).</p>
<p>Refer to the below block diagram to understand where things fits in.</p>
<p><img alt="block diagram" src="../assets/Arduino_actuator_blk_dgm.jpg" /></p>
<p>Arduino board should be running the standard firmata sketch (This sketch comes by default when you download the arduino tool). Load the standard firmata sketch (from <em>Examples &gt; Firmata &gt; StandardFirmata</em>) onto the Arduino.
<img alt="wiring diagram" src="../assets/Arduino_firmata_sketch.jpg" /> 
Further <strong>pymata_aio_</strong> python package needs to be installed on the car computer via <em>pip3 install pymata_aio</em>.</p>
<p>As shown in the block-diagram above LattePanda combines both the x86 CPU and the Connected Arduino into a single board.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows how to connect the Arduino pins to steering servo and ESC.</p>
<p><img alt="wiring diagram" src="../assets/ArduinoWiring.png" />
Note that the power for the servo is provided by the ESC battery elemininator circuit (BEC) which most ESC's provide.
This is done to avoid supplying the entire servo power from Arduino's 5v.
In large RC cars the servo can drag up to 2 amps, which lead to a destruction of the Arduino.</p>
<h3 id="calibration">Calibration</h3>
<p>Note that the calibration procedure/values are slightly different for the Arduino (than PCA9685).
Note that 90 is the usual midpoint (i.e. 1.5 ms pulse width at 50 Hz), so it is recommended to start
 with 90 and adjust +/- 5 until you figure the desired range for steering / throttle.</p>

<p>An inexpensive Donkeycar compatible robot can be constructed using a cheap smart car robot chassis that includes 2 DC gear motors and an L298N motor driver or compatible to run the motors.  Steering is accomplished by running one motor faster than the other, causing the car to drive in an arc.  The motor driver can be wired in one of two ways; 3 pin wiring or 2 pin wiring.</p>
<h3 id="3-pin-hbridge-differential-drive">3-pin HBridge Differential Drive</h3>
<p>2 DC gear motors are controlled with an L298N, each motor using two TTL output pins to select direction and a PWM pin to control the power to the motor.  Since each motor uses 3 pins, so a total of 6 pins are used in a differential drive configuration. The advantage of this wiring scheme is that it only requires 2 PWM pins, which happens to be the maximum number of PWM pins on the Jetson Nano.</p>

<li>In the configuration, the HBRIDGE_L298N_PIN_xxxx_EN pins determine how fast the motors spin.  These pins must support PWM output.  Remember that the Jetson Nano only supports 2 PWM output pins and only if they are enabled using <code>/opt/nvidia/jetson-io/jetson-io.py</code>. See <a href="../pins/#generating-pwm-from-the-jetson-nano">Generating PWM from the Jetson Nano</a>.</li>
<li>The HBRIDGE_L298N_PIN_xxxx_FWD and HBRIDGE_L298N_PIN_xxxx_BWD pins are TTL output pins that determine the direction the motors spin.</li>
</ul>

<p>2 DC Motors controlled with an 'mini' L298N HBridge, each motor using 2 PWM pins; one pwm pin to enable and control forward speed and one to enable and control reverse motor speed.  This advantage of this wiring method is that it only requires a total of 4 pins.</p>
<p>See https://www.instructables.com/Tutorial-for-Dual-Channel-DC-Motor-Driver-Board-PW/ for how an L298N mini-HBridge modules is wired in 2-pin mode. This driver can also be used with an L9110S/HG7881 motor driver.  See https://electropeak.com/learn/interfacing-l9110s-dual-channel-h-bridge-motor-driver-module-with-arduino/ for how an L9110S motor driver module is wired.</p>
